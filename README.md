# DesignPatternRefresher-Decorator-Using-DI
The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is achieved by creating a set of decorator classes used to wrap concrete components.

Here is a WeatherForecst example, where WeatherForeCachingDecorator class is used as a wrapper to add more functionality(Caching) to a concrete implementation WeaterForecast service, and register the decorator class in .Net DI container. Check the repo for more info. Enjoy!
